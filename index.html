            Linus Benedict Torvalds
            (born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel,
            used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision
            control system Git and the scuba dive logging and planning software Subsurface.
            He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka,
            with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland
            "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for
            computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel." He is also the recipient of the
            2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award and the 2018 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award.
